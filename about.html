        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Hello, I'm Felicia Monique</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm a certified Special Education teacher who believes that the world's classrooms hold the keys to understanding humanity. What started as a career in special education has evolved into a global journey of discovery, cultural exchange, and educational innovation.</p>
            
            <p>Through my experiences teaching in South Korea and Saudi Arabia, and exploring educational practices in Mexico, Peru, Malaysia, Thailand, and Jordan, I've learned that while our languages, traditions, and teaching methods may differ, our commitment to helping every child succeed is universal.</p>

        <!-- Teaching Philosophy -->
        <section id="teaching-philosophy">
            <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>As a certified Special Education teacher with experience from Pre-K through high school, my approach to education is rooted in empathy, equity, and curiosity. Teaching and living internationally ‚Äî in South Korea, Saudi Arabia, and beyond ‚Äî has deeply shaped how I connect with students. These experiences have shown me that while language and culture may differ, the need to be seen, heard, and supported is universal.</p>
                
                <p>I believe every child deserves a learning environment where they feel safe, valued, and inspired to explore. I strive to create hands-on, inclusive experiences that not only spark curiosity but also nurture a sense of empathy for others. My hope is that students leave my classroom not just with academic skills, but with a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <h3>Core Beliefs That Guide My Teaching</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Every Child Has Unique Gifts:</strong> My international experiences have reinforced that intelligence and ability manifest differently across cultures and individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Competency is Essential:</strong> Understanding a student's cultural background is as important as understanding their learning profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy Transcends Language:</strong> Connection and care can be communicated without words, but they must be intentionally cultivated.</li>
                <li><strong>Learning is a Community Effort:</strong> The best educational outcomes happen when families, communities, and schools work together.</li>
                <li><strong>Adaptability is Key:</strong> What works in one culture or classroom may need to be completely reimagined for another‚Äîand that's the beauty of teaching.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Inspire other educators</strong> to consider how global perspectives can enrich their teaching practice, whether they travel internationally or simply embrace cultural diversity in their local communities.</li>

                <li><strong>Advocate for inclusive education</strong> by sharing examples of how different cultures support students with diverse learning needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Encourage cultural curiosity</strong> in both educators and travelers who want to understand the world through the lens of learning and human connection.</li>
